<h1>VPC Networking Basics</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The purpose of this project is to show how to build a basic virtual private cloud (VPC) in AWS. The architecture of this VPC models a three-tiered web application structure -- containing 2 availability zones (AZ), three subnets per AZ, an internet gateway and a NAT gateway.
<br />
<br />
Note: This project is based on the AWS Skillbuilder lab, Amazon VPC Networking Basics. Lab steps were followed on my personal AWS account and all screenshots are original.
